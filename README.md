# test_tileMovement
A program that tests tile based movement from a top-down perspective.

Title is self explanatory. This is a program where you can move in a grid with tile based movement by using the arrow keys. I also learned how to draw a basic grid with code, that'll definitely be useful in the future. I guess it's way easier than making a grid image myself. Also, the console prints your current grid position. You're free to use this as a reference or as foundation for your own projects. I don't really care.
